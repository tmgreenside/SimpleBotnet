# SimpleBotnet
I found the source code for this at https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/python-programming-hackers-part-6-creating-ssh-botnet/ and tested it on my own virtual machines.

To implement: create two virtual machines, one of which will be Command and Control server to send instructions to the underlings. the
second VM will be an underling.  Use the addClient() function to add any VMs or servers you want.  Underlings must be configured to accept
SSH connections.
